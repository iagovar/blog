<div id="goals">
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	I'd like to become a data scientist, as it matches my education and my mindset. Since I lack the technical skills for doing so, I'm teaching myself programming, firstly through front-end dev, as I believe it's the best way to introduce myself into software jobs, gain experience with industry-standard tools and skills, and pivot afterwards.

	<h2>Showcases</h2>
	<h3>About my analytical skills:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Twitch Payout analysis: <a href="https://iagovar.com/twitch-leak-en">[Link]</a> Carried mainly witk Knime and Excel.</li>
		<li>Podemos Plaza Pública Analysis (Spanish): <a href="https://iagovar.com/plaza-podemos-como-ha-funcionado-hasta-ahora">[Link]</a> Carried out mainly with Excel and a scraper (thus, required knowledge of CSS Selectors)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Failed projects:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>From 09 to 19 I've tried: Two communities and several micro-niche websites. The SEO & Affiliation landscape changed a lot, and I lacked both the funding and the skillset to scale up the operations. Also, I was excesively dependent on one main client (A Dating App) that was about 60-70% of my income, and they closed their partner program after Brexit. Communities also got harder and harder to adquire users after ~2012 so in terms of input/output it wasn't really worth the effort, specially for generalist ones. At the beginning of 2020 I decided to sell all domains and move on.</li>
		<li><a href="https://picoscraper.com/">Picoscraper</a> was born from a project ordered to a programmer in early 2020. We decided to partner up and launch it as a product, but I soon realized that my skills as a one-man band for previous projects did not translate well to a shared project, and that my contributions, without sufficient programming knowledge, were limited to the website, documentation, and the occasional python function that did not require too much complexity. My partner also had financial problems so he focused on his work, and we abandoned the project. This is what pushed me to take and learn development seriously.</li>
