I currently have a Thinkpad x260 with XFCE as main laptop. I use it mostly for coding, writing, reading, and studying. Sometimes I watch movies or videos in it.

I live in the rainy northern Spain. Every morning I check the weather forecast for that day. If I see sun, I get my backpack with water, a towel, and sunscreen, and get some sandwich/empanada/tupper from the fridge, put my laptop in my backpack, and go somewhere quiet near shore, or in the woods.

Once I'm there, I open my laptop, use my phone as hotspot, and work for 30 mins to one hour alternating with swimming if near shore, sunbathing or just contemplating nature. It's very relaxing, it gives me a lot of peace of mind and I can focus much better compared to when I'm sitting in home or in office.

Now, there's a limiting factor. Working outdoors with a laptop requires putting brightness to 100%, and dealing with some reflections, which causes a lot of eye strain, so sometimes, despite being 100% focused I need to stop for > 20 mins, or it gets to a point where I can't deal with it anymore.

Also, while my ARM phone is capable of dealing with +6h outside with no problem, my laptop struggles a bit. I have to be sure it's 100% charged every morning, or it gets risky. [TLP](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TLP) and [Slimbook Batery](https://github.com/slimbook/slimbookbattery) helped a lot with it, but sometimes you need some extra power, and you know you're shaving a lot of battery time.

I've been searching for a solution on this problem high and low, without success. There are thousands of threads in HackerNews, Reddit and dedicated communities on this, like [EI2030](https://forum.ei2030.org/), yet it seems to be a very niche problem that doesn't get attention from hardware manufacturers. And it probably is like this because most people in the tech community believes it isn't feasible/desirable. They imagine the screen of their ebook reader.
